/**
 * Helpers for resolving numeric runtime-tuning constants from environment
 * variables.
 *
 * Several SDK constants (timeouts, retry counts, stream buffering, …) are
 * useful to tune per-deployment — most notably to dial them down on a
 * dedicated e2e deployment so the test suite exercises edge paths (reconnects,
 * batch splitting, retries) that otherwise only trigger after long durations
 * or large payloads.
 *
 * `envNumber` reads `process.env[name]` lazily (so tests and deployments can
 * override per invocation), clamps to an optional `[min, max]` range, and
 * never throws — an env override is an escape hatch, not a hard requirement,
 * so an invalid value falls back to the constant's compiled-in default. A
 * misconfigured value warns once per process so the mistake is observable
 * without spamming logs.
