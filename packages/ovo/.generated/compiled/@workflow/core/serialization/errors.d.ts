 * `SerializationError` (which classifies as `USER_ERROR`). That's correct
 * for genuine serialization failures, but a `RuntimeDecryptionError` from
 * the AES-GCM layer is an SDK-internal failure that must keep its identity
 * so the run-failure classifier routes it to `RUNTIME_ERROR`. Call this at
 * the top of each serialize catch block to let those errors propagate
 * unchanged.
