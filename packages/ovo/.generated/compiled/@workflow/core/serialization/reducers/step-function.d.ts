/**
 * Reducer and reviver for step function references.
 *
 * In workflow mode, step functions are replaced by the SWC plugin with
 * proxies created by `globalThis[Symbol.for("WORKFLOW_USE_STEP")]("stepId")`.
 * These proxies have a `.stepId` property and optionally a `.__closureVarsFn`
 * for captured closure variables. They may additionally have `.__boundThis`
 * (and rarely `.__boundArgs`) when the SWC plugin emitted
 * `useStep(...).bind(this)` for a nested arrow step that lexically
 * captured `this` (see `packages/swc-plugin-workflow/spec.md` → "Lexical
 * `this` Capture in Nested Arrow Steps").
 *
 * The reducer serializes them as
 *   `{ stepId, closureVars?, boundThis?, boundArgs? }`.
 * The reviver reconstructs them by calling WORKFLOW_USE_STEP and, when
 * `boundThis` (or `boundArgs`) is present, re-binding the resulting
 * proxy so the caller's captured `this` (and prefilled args) survive the
 * round trip.
