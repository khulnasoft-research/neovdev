/**
 * Composable compression layer for serialized data.
 *
 * Wraps/unwraps serialized payloads with a compression codec, using the
 * format prefix system to mark compressed data (e.g. 'zstd' or 'gzip'
 * wrapping the inner format: 'zstd' + zstd('devl' + payload)).
 *
 * Codec selection (write side): zstd is preferred — it is markedly faster
 * than gzip at a comparable-or-better ratio (see scripts/README.md), and
 * compression runs at every step boundary so the write CPU is a per-step
 * tax. zstd requires `node:zlib` >= 22.15 (Web `CompressionStream` has no
 * zstd), so on a runtime without it we fall back to gzip via the portable
 * `CompressionStream`. `WORKFLOW_COMPRESSION_CODEC=gzip` forces the
 * portable codec.
 *
 * Read side: dispatch on the format prefix, so both 'zstd' and 'gzip'
 * payloads are always decodable regardless of which codec wrote them.
 * (The browser o11y read path decodes zstd via a registered WASM decoder —
 * see `serialization-format.ts`; this module's `decompress` is the Node
 * runtime/replay path and uses `node:zlib`.)
 *
 * Layering order with encryption: compression is applied BEFORE
 * encryption (encr(zstd(devl))) — encrypted bytes are high-entropy and
 * do not compress, so the reverse order would be a no-op.
 *
 * Compression is conditional:
 * - Payloads smaller than {@link COMPRESSION_MIN_BYTES} are passed
 *   through unchanged (codec overhead isn't worth it).
 * - If the compressed result isn't meaningfully smaller than the
 *   original (see {@link COMPRESSION_MIN_SAVINGS_RATIO}), the original
 *   is kept. This protects already-compressed binary payloads (images,
 *   archives, etc.) from wasted CPU and size inflation.
 */

 * Payloads below this size are never compressed. The 4-byte format
 * prefix + codec header/trailer overhead means small payloads gain
 * nothing, and tiny ones would grow.
