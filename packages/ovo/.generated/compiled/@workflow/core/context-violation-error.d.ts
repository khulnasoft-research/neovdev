/**
 * Base class for structured context-violation errors.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *
 * - `.message` is **plain text** (no ANSI escape bytes). Structured logs,
 *   log drains, CBOR-serialized event data, and anything else that reads
 *   `err.message` / `err.stack` as a string gets clean output — no mojibake
 *   in JSON, no `\x1B[...m` noise in Vercel logs.
 *
 * - The ANSI-framed version is rendered **lazily** via `toString()` and
 *   `[util.inspect.custom]`. When the error is thrown and Node prints it
 *   via `util.inspect`, the user sees the colored, framed box. When it's
 *   attached to a structured log field, the consumer sees plain text.
 *
 * - `fatal = true` marks these as non-retryable. Calling `createHook()`
 *   from a step function will never succeed no matter how many retries —
 *   burning attempts just produces duplicated log output. The runtime's
 *   `FatalError.is(err)` gate recognizes any error with `fatal: true`.
