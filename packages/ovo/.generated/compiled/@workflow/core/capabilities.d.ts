/**
 * Capabilities table for workflow runs based on their `@workflow/core` version.
 *
 * When resuming a hook or webhook, the payload must be encoded in a format
 * that the *target* workflow run's deployment can decode. This module provides
 * a way to look up what serialization formats a given `@workflow/core` version
 * supports, so that newer deployments can avoid encoding payloads in formats
 * that older deployments don't understand (e.g., the `encr` encryption format).
 *
 * ## Adding a new format
 *
 * When a new serialization format is introduced:
 * 1. Add the format constant to `SerializationFormat` in `serialization.ts`
 * 2. Add an entry to `FORMAT_VERSION_TABLE` below with the minimum
 *    `@workflow/core` version that supports it
 * 3. The `getRunCapabilities()` function will automatically include it
 *
 * ## Adding a new non-format capability
 *
 * Some capabilities aren't serialization format prefixes — e.g.
 * byte-stream wire framing is an envelope around chunks rather than
 * a content format. For those, add a boolean field to `RunCapabilities`
 * and an entry in `CAPABILITY_VERSION_TABLE` below.
 *
 * ## History
 *
 * - `encr` (AES-256-GCM encryption): added in `4.2.0-beta.64`
 *   Commit: 7618ac36 "Wire AES-GCM encryption into serialization layer (#1251)"
 *   https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/7618ac36
 * - `framedByteStreams` (wire-level chunk framing for byte streams): added in `5.0.0-beta.15`
 * - `gzip` (gzip payload compression): added in `5.0.0-beta.18`
 * - `zstd` (zstd payload compression, preferred codec): added in `5.0.0-beta.18`
 *   alongside gzip — they co-ship, so any run that can read one can read both.
