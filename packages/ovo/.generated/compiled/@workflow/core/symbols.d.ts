 * the descriptor it emits. The child run's step-side reviver then opens

 * that run's encryption key directly — so the child's writes land on
 * the parent's stream as-is, with no client process in the loop. That
 * keeps the forwarding alive for the full lifetime of the child run,
 * not just for the parent step that initiated `start()`.
