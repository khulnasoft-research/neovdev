 * every wake replay derives the same key, so fan-out stays capped at one
 * pending backstop per step. But when owner recovery re-stamps the step
 * (queue redelivery of the owning message → new `step_started` → new
 * `lastStartedAt`), the key CHANGES. This is load-bearing for liveness:
 * queues dedupe an idempotency key for the lifetime of the original
 * message — including while a delivery of it is in flight — so a backstop
 * that fires during a refreshed lease and tries to re-arm under a fixed key
 * would dedupe against ITSELF and be dropped, leaving no escape hatch if
 * the recovered owner later dies without further redeliveries. The epoch
 * suffix gives the re-arm a fresh key. Pending backstops are bounded by the
 * number of ownership epochs, i.e. the queue's redelivery budget for the
 * owning message.
 *
 * The epoch value comes from the persisted event's `createdAt`, so every
 * replayer derives the same key. Callers only build backstops when the
 * lease has time remaining, which requires `lastStartedAt` to be set.
 *
 * The key must also never be the step message's own `idempotencyKey`
 * (the bare correlation ID): the owner's retry handoff enqueues the step
 * under that key with a short backoff, and a pending backstop sharing it
 * would absorb the retry — turning a 1s backoff into a full-lease stall.
