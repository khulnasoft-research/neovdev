 * The Web Streams API does not expose an event for "lock released but stream
 * still open"; we can only distinguish that state by periodically attempting
 * to acquire a reader/writer. For that reason we use polling instead of a
 * fully event-driven approach here.
 *
 * 10ms is chosen so the polling tick almost never sits on the critical path:
 * the V2 step-executor's `opsSettled` race waits for this state to resolve
 * after each step body returns, so a coarser interval (the previous 100ms)
 * adds visible per-step latency to streaming workflows. With a uniformly
 * distributed offset between step return and the next tick, the expected
 * wait is half the interval — so 10ms means ~5ms average wait per step
 * instead of ~50ms. The per-tick work is `writable.locked` plus a
 * `getWriter()`/`releaseLock()` probe, both microsecond-scale; 10× more
 * ticks during a stream's lifetime is not measurable in practice.
