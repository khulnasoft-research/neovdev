/**
 * Remaps an error stack trace using inline source maps to show original source locations.
 *
 * Degrades gracefully when the bundle has no inline source map (e.g. production
 * builds, where maps are off by default): the original stack is returned
 * unchanged. A cheap `filename` presence check skips all work when no frame
 * references the workflow file, and parsed source maps are memoized per bundle.
 *
 * @param stack - The error stack trace to remap
 * @param filename - The workflow filename to match in stack frames
 * @param workflowCode - The workflow bundle code containing inline source maps
 * @returns The remapped stack trace with original source locations
