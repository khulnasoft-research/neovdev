   * Keyed by the delivery's position (index) in the consumed event log.
   *
   * The problem: a buffered hook payload is observed via the async hook
   * iterator (`yield await this`), costing extra microtask hops, while a
   * `wait_completed` resolves with fewer hops — and a reused sleep can
   * resolve in an entirely earlier loop iteration. Either way, the
   * resolution that the committed event log ordered first can lose a
   * `Promise.race` to a faster- or already-resolved competitor, diverging
   * from the log and surfacing as `CorruptedEventLogError`.
   *
   * The fix is a strict, deterministic delivery order anchored on
   * event-log position: a delivery does not resolve to the workflow until
   * every earlier-in-log delivery of the OPPOSITE kind has been delivered.
   * (Opposite kind only: sequential same-kind hook payloads must not block
   * one another, and a wait need not wait behind a later wait.) Because the
   * gate is "the earlier delivery resolved", not "won a timing race", the
   * outcome is independent of microtask hops, hydration/decryption time,
   * and `Promise.race` argument order.
   *
   * Index is used rather than the `eventId` string because `eventId` is an
   * opaque, world-assigned value not guaranteed to sort in creation order
   * (only the bundled ULID worlds happen to).
   *
   * Optional so older/out-of-tree contexts (and lightweight test harnesses)
   * that do not initialize it degrade gracefully to the previous behavior.
