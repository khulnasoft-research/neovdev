 *   enum — callers should not narrow on it blindly. Values that don't
 *   match a known `RUN_ERROR_CODES` entry fall through to USER_ERROR.

 *   persisted today; callers that have access to it (either via an

 *   the attribution and hint. When absent, `describeRunError` still

 *
 * - `SerializationError` is technically raised by the SDK, but it almost
 *   always points at something the caller did (passed a non-serializable
 *   value, didn't register a class). We attribute it to the user.
 * - Context-violation errors (`NotInWorkflowContextError`, etc.) likewise
 *   describe a user mistake.
 * - `WorkflowRuntimeError` (and subclasses like `StepNotRegisteredError`)
 *   indicates an internal SDK invariant broke — surface that as `sdk`.
 *
 * @param err The error value thrown by the workflow / step.
 * @param errorCode Optional precomputed error code. Callers that already
 *   know the code (e.g. `REPLAY_TIMEOUT` or `MAX_DELIVERIES_EXCEEDED`, which
 *   `classifyRunError` can't derive from the error alone) should pass it so
 *   the attribution and hint reflect the actual failure category.
