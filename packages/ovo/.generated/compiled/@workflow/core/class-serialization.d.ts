 * varies with the app's dependency layout and bundler. Host-side code
 * that needs to construct `Run` instances inside the workflow VM (e.g.
 * the hook event consumer resolving `hook.getConflict()`) cannot know
 * that id statically, so the workflow-mode `create-hook` module also
 * aliases the bundle's `Run` under this stable id at evaluation time.

 * defines `classId` as non-configurable, so a second `defineProperty`
 * would throw. Aliasing only adds a registry entry — the class keeps
 * serializing under its primary (path-derived) id, while lookups succeed
 * under both.
 *
 * Registration is per-global by construction: evaluated inside the

 * evaluated on the host it registers the host class on the host's
